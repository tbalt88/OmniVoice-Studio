"""A quit mid-preload must not report a clean shutdown while a GPU-pool
thread is still running (#1000 class).

Field report: a backend log showed three rapid restart cycles, each ending
with "Shutdown: done." immediately followed by a "Model loading failed:
Could not import module 'AutoFeatureExtractor'" error — transformers' own
generic lazy-import wrapper, not a real dependency problem. The real cause:
`preload_task` (and the optional `capture_preload_task`) were created at
startup but never referenced in the shutdown block, so `idle_task`/
`worker_task` got cancelled-and-awaited while the preload task was simply
abandoned — the process declared "done" while a background GPU-pool thread
was still mid-`import`, and got torn down by interpreter finalization under
it.

`_cancel_and_await_tasks` is the extracted, directly-testable shutdown
helper — the full `lifespan()` context manager touches too much startup
machinery (DB init, gallery init, MCP session manager) to drive directly in
a unit test (this suite's own test_mcp_mount.py notes exactly this: running
the full lifespan contaminates other tests' event loops).
